## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (RECOMMENDED ORDER)

1. **Security First**: Implement bcrypt password hashing and JWT tokens
2. **User Experience**: Add loading states and better error handling
3. **Performance**: Implement image lazy loading and compression
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Create proper README and API docs

## NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS

- The current plain text password storage is explicitly marked as "demo only" - this should be the first priority to fix
- The project has a solid foundation with modern tech stack
- The AI integration with Gemini Flash API is well implemented
- The responsive design and dark mode support show attention to UX
- Consider implementing a proper backend API separate from Next.js API routes for better scalability
- The auto-delete feature after 3 days is a good privacy feature but consider making it configurable
